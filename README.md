This is the Rails Back End API for my React App 'Fridge Magnets'.

It's a fun little web clone of those fridge magnet poetry sets you played around with.

Check out the app here, and make some silly poems, follow and favorite other users and their creations: https://magnet-fridge.herokuapp.com/

The API can be found here: https://magnet-fridge-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users (other endpoints are /poems, /words, /relationships, /favorited_poems)
